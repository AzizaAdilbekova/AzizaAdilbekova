# Hi, I'm Aziza  
Data Analyst | SQL • Python • BI • A/B Testing • Analytics

I am a data analyst focused on transforming raw data into clear and actionable insights.  
I work with SQL, Python, analytics methods, and BI tools to solve business problems, analyze user behavior, and build informative dashboards.

Before transitioning into analytics, I worked as an English teacher and educational administrator. This experience strengthened my communication, problem-solving skills, and attention to detail — qualities that help me in analytical work.
